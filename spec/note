What is rspec

* Domain-specific language testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code
* A behavior-driven development framework

What is BDD & TDD / What’s the Difference? (TDD & BDD)

* BDD is designed to test an application's behavior from the end user's standpoint
* BDD is a development technique that focuses on the system's behavior

* TDD is focused on testing smaller pieces of functionality in isolation.
* TDD is a development technique that focuses more on the implementation of a feature.

How You’re Testing

* BDD involves product managers, developers, and test engineers who collaborate to come up
  with concrete examples of desirable functionality.

* TDD can be done by a solo developer without any external input

How They Work Together(BDD / TDD)

describe Person do
	context 'When testing the Person class' do
		it "should say 'Callie Trop' when we call the name method" do
		end
	end
end

Developers can then add TDD elements to test specific objects:

it "should say 'Callie Trop' when we call the name method" do
	person = Person.new
	person_name = person.name
	expect(person_name).to eq 'Callie Trop'
end

What are describe, context & it key words

The describe Keyword

* Is an RSpec keyword.
* Used to define an "Example Group".
* You can think as a collection of tests.
* Can take a class name and/or string

The context Keyword
* Is similar to describe.
* It too can accept a class name and/or string argument.
* The idea of context is that it encloses tests of a certain type. (Give Example => Update)
* Not mandatory, but it helps to add more details about the examples

The it Keyword
* Used to define an “Example”
* Example is basically a test or a test case.
* It describes that expected outcome is for the Example.

The expect Keyword
* Used to define an “Expectation” in RSpec.
* expect(message).to eql "Hello World!"

The to keyword

* Used as part of expect statements
* You can also use the not_to

The eql keyword
* Simply matcher
